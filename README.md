- Certain router-encryptions are not supported (e.g. WPA-WPA2 mixed), an update to WPA2 helps here
- Test if your connection works by running `Arduino` —> `Examples` —> `WiFi101` —> `ConnectWithWPA` / `ConnectWithWEP` (depending on the encryption type of the router)
- More infos about the [WiFi101-Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFi101)
